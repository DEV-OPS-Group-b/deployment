For the quality assessment of the code, we used online tools integrated with github.com, namely sonarcloud.io, codeclimate.com and bettercodehub.com. We got good results, especially for the backend where bettercodehub.com, for example, showed that the code is loosely coupled, the blocks are simple with no duplications. The results were slightly different for the web application where we got some duplicate code from codeclimate.com but sonarcloud.io showed no duplications for the same project and thus we decided not to take any action.
