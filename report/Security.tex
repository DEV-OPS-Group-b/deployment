    For the frontend, we tried to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection attacks, which both failed because React sanitizes all inputs by default. We also tried to upload a file in a random input field without success because React only accepts file inputs from an Input field with the “File” type which we do not have either. On the other hand, we have broken authentication and session management because we execute the login by making a simple request that contains the plaintext username and password (thus visible to anyone that sniffs the network with a tool like Wireshark for example). Moreover, we manage the login state by keeping the username in local storage meaning anyone who creates such local storage key-value pair and access our application is automatically logged in with the user whose local storage’s username appears. A possible remedy for these issues will be to never send unencrypted login details to the web server and to implement some sort of token, like the JWT token that has expiration and based on it to validate the login state of a user. However, that would take time to implement and we decided it's not of high priority as for the objective of this course. 
    For the backend, we did some port scanning and found some possible exploits but neither of them was successful.
